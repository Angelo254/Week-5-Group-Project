 A DATA ANALYSIS REPORT ON THE IMPACT OF AIR POLLUTION ON THE HEALTH SECTOR WITH EMPHASIS ON RESPIRATORY DISEASES.

BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

Problem Overview

Air Pollution is the presence of a substance that has harmful or poisonous effects in the air.
Particulate matter(also called particle pollution): The term for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. Some particles, such as dust, dirt, soot, or smoke, are large or dark enough to be seen with the naked eye. Others are so small they can only be detected using an electron microscope.
Respiratory diseases affect the lungs and other parts of the respiratory system. Some of the respiratory diseases include asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonia, and lung cancer. Also called lung disorder and pulmonary disease.
 
  	1.1.  Introduction
 
SDG #3 is Good Health and Well-Being. This can be achieved through special emphasis on curbing air pollution, one of the biggest health threats facing humanity. Its impacts are already harming peopleâ€™s health through air pollution, disease, extreme weather events, forced displacement, food insecurity, and pressure on mental health. Every year, environmental factors take the lives of approximately 13 million people.
 
 
 
 
1.2. Challenge / Problem
 
Air pollution continues to be a significant concern to public health worldwide and a tough problem confronted by both developed and developing countries. In developed countries like the United States and European countries, air pollution has been rather severe and remains a considerable environmental problem. Compared to most developed countries that have rapidly progressed in industrialization for years, developing countries in Africa are also confronting more severe air pollution due to intense energy consumption, large-scale demolition, and reconstruction projects, and increased emissions from transportation in the process of industrialization and urbanization. These are all major factors contributing to air pollution.
 
The health effects of air pollution remain a public concern. The adverse effects vary with the kinds of pollutants and locale. For instance, outdoor air pollutants like PM, NO2, and SO2 can increase mortality. Long-term exposure to air pollutants can increase mortality, particularly from respiratory diseases. (Some of the respiratory diseases include asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonia, and lung cancer. Also called lung disorder and pulmonary disease.)
 
1.3. Proposed solution to the problem.
 
We expect to link deaths due to respiratory diseases to the concentration of air pollutants in their respective locales.
This research is expected to rally awareness on the burden of air pollution to the health sector of countries, thus mobilizing countries to channel resources towards action to reduce air pollution as compared to dealing with the increasing number of respiratory diseases.
The resources allocated to combating air pollution are much less as compared to dealing with these detrimental diseases eg. Lung Cancer, asthma, chronic respiratory infections.
 
 
 
Business Objectives
 
2.1. Overall objective
To understand the burden of air pollution on the health sector by finding the relationship between mortality rates due to respiratory diseases and air pollutant concentrations in Africa.
 
2.2. Specific objectives
To Identify which country has the highest pollutant concentration.
To identify the country with the highest mortality rate.
To identify the gender with the highest mortality rate.


3.  Business Success Criteria
To investigate how air quality has posed a huge burden to the health sector in Africa. The health focus in this project will be on respiratory diseases.
